# hello-world
Hi everyone!
I am Kenneth,  geopysicist with interest in several gephysical methods particularly seismic and magnetotellurics.
I would love to apply these techniques for near surface and deep exploration, in addition to studying the subsurface properties in general.
I am just getting started with Git.
